# Particle-Life-Physics-Simulator
A particle life simulator will simulate particles, given some laws about how the particles will interact with each other.
To run this simulator, download these files or folders:

-renderdata (folder)
-partlifenew.py
-partliferender.py

Note to keep these in the SAME PLACE

renderdata (folder) aready contains some test renders that you could test. To simulate, you need to run partlifenew.py. Note that this will simulate particles, 
which could be very slow. After this, go to the render file, to replay your simulation much faster. You could also replay some test renders. Keep in mind that 
you should not delete the renderdoc.txt data file, because it contains the data, for each run. If you like a particular run, you can have the option to copy
that render, so that you can replay it later. Note that when you exit the program, the current render WILL BE DELETED (so if you like a render, make sure
to save it using one of the buttons). 

This program might simulate very very slowly. To make it a reasonable speed, you can decrease the amount of particles.
